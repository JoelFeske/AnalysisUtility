This utility can be used to backfill and recalculate analyses in bulk, or to see which analyses are writing to a certain PI Tag.

Command line parameters:

	* Parameter names in brackets denote optional parameters
	* Parameter names are NOT case sensitive
	* To pass a parameter value that includes a space, enclose it in double quotes

[/AFServer]: The name of the AF Server machine hosting your AF Database. If left out, the default AF Server will be used.
	Aliases: /server

[/AFDatabase]: The name of the AF Database containing the analyses to be backfilled. If left out, the default database on the specified AF Server will be used.
	Aliases: /database
		 /db

[/SearchRootPath]: The utility will only search elements below the element specified in this path. E.g. if you pass the path "NuGreen\Houston\Cracking Process\Equipment", the utility will search only elements that are children (or grandchildren, etc.) of Equipment. If left out, the utility will search the entire database.
	Aliases: /root

[/ElementName]: The name of the element that contains the analyses to be backfilled. Accepts wildcards**, used to specify multiple elements at once.  If left out, all element names will be matched.
	Aliases: /element
		 /elem

[/ElementTemplate]: The template of the element that contains the analysis to be backfilled. This allows you to backfill only analyses using a certain template. Accepts wildcards**, used to specify multiple templates at once.
	Aliases: /template

[/AnalysisName]: The name of the analyses to be backfilled. Accepts wildcards**, used to specify multiple analyses at once. If left out, all analysis names will be matched.
	Aliases: /analysis

[/SearchFullHierarchy]: If true, the utility will search the entire tree below the element specified in /SearchRootPath. If left blank, its default value is false.

/StartTime: When to start the backfill/recalculation. Format "mm/dd/yyyy [hh:mm:ss]". Also accepts PI Time syntax.
	Aliases: /start
		 /st

/EndTime: When to end the backfill/recalculation. Format "mm/dd/yyyy [hh:mm:ss]". Also accepts PI Time syntax.
	Aliases: /end
		 /et
                                     
[/TagName]: Required if /Mode == findTagInputs. The tag name for which to search for input analyses.  
	Aliases: /tag
		 /pitag
		 /pipoint

/Mode:  Values: "backfill"    	- Default value. Fill data gaps in time range
                "recalculate" 	- Delete existing data and recalculate data in time range
                "findTagInputs" - Print out the paths to all analyses writing to the tag specified by /TagName
			Aliases: /inputs

[/Help]: Prints this help file.
	Aliases: /?

** Wildcards: 

The query string (or match pattern) can include regular characters and wildcard characters. Regular characters must match exactly the characters specified in the query string. Wildcard characters can be matched with arbitrary fragments of the query string. Wildcard characters can be escaped using the single backslash (\) character. Use a double backslash (\\) to match a single backslash. The syntax of the query string has the following rules:
	-If null or empty string, then everything will be matched.
	-If no wildcards, then an exact match on the query string is performed.
	-Wildcard * can be placed anywhere in the query string and matches zero or more characters.
	-Wildcard ? can be placed anywhere in the query string and matches exactly one character.
	-One character in a set of characters are matched by placing them within [ ]. For example, a[bc] would match 'ab' or 'ac', but it would not match 'ad' or 'abd'.
	-One character in a set of characters are not matched by placing them within [! ]. For example, a[!bc] would match 'ad', but it would not match 'ab', 'ac', or 'abd'.
